# grimworld-lasguns-mjeiouwsfork

Hi! This is a somewhat (very) outdated fork of [Sparky](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199057353785)'s wonderful mod [Grimworld Lasguns](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2894628781&searchtext=lasguns).

Most of the changes I've made:
- added a new damagedef which leaves shredded injuries (pulse lasers kaboomy) in flesh and burns on bones and mechanoids! It is affected by sharp armour.
- added four new sounds I mixed, in an effort to more closely match actual lasgun pews. I did not succeed. Still cool though.
- guns are made with plasteel, uranium, and components, because that's what made the most sense to me. Maybe should have switched for one or two advanced components, but what goes.
- Accatran and laspistols currently both fire the same damage round, which also has a much higher chance of starting fires.
- This fork is a little unbalanced! But I didn't care at the time, 'cuz I made this for myself.
- The Kantrael should be roughly equivalent to an burny, armour-penetrating assault rifle.
- lucius MVP.
- Sloppily recoloured the guns to be grey; red and green looked a little festive in my concrete colony.
